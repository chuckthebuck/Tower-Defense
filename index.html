<h4>  For anyone not aware, this is NOT Bloons Tower Defense. This is my game, and ORIGINAL game where circles beat other circles. Down here, you can find info about turrets and the game!<h4>
 
  <h2>Semi Auto Turret<h2>
  <h3>  The de facto early game turret. It can be used to finish enemies or to weaken them! They don't benefit much from upgrades, so they aren't so useful during the later waves.<h3>

  <h2>Mini Turret<h2>
    <h3>  The perfect chip damage in the early game! They can be put together in mass or if 50 money is burning a hole in your pocket, you can place one of these to help out!<h3>  

<h2>Shotgun Turret<h2>          
    <h3>  A turret that can chip for a low price. It has low range but great damage that can thin out or weaken the horde! <h3>  
      
      <h2>Sniper Turret<h2>          
    <h3> It's long gun allows the sniper turret to weaken or defeat stronger enemies. When the turret is placed right, it can view the entire path, but it might miss if the enemy is too fast. <h3> 

      <h2>Money Making Turret<h2>  
    <h3>  A complex turret that is great at getting cash for your more costly upgrades. Every time the money making turret hits an enemy, you get some money. If you want this turret, I recommend upgrading it once for more money. <h3>   

      <h2>Minigun Turret<h2>  
    <h3>  A great turret for it's firepower and range. It's downside? The hefty cost of 550 cash!<h3> 
            
      <h2>50,000 Volt Tazer Turret<h2>  
    <h3>  A turret that slows down enemies as well as doing good damage. If your sniper turret needs more consistant shots, or your minigun wants that extra time for damage, its a great choice.<h3>  
      <h2>Focused Lazer Turret<h2>  
    <h3>  A turret that shoots a lazer beam toward wherever your mouse is pointed. When you point your cursor at the enemy, it will do loads of damage from wherever on the map! It's 12k money though.<h3>
